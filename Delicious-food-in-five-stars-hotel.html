The meat is typically cut into thick slices and then cooked on a grill, in a pan, or under a broiler. There are several different types of steak, with varying degrees of tenderness and flavour. Some popular cuts include filet mignon, ribeye, sirloin, and New York strip. The way in which the steak is prepared can also have a significant impact on its flavour, with some people preferring to grill or pan-sear their steak, while others prefer to slow-cook it in an oven or smoker. Steak is a good source of protein, iron, and other important nutrients. However, it is also high in saturated fat and calories, so it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</li>

Shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and clams, are also popular seafood options. They are high in protein, vitamins, and minerals, but may also contain high levels of cholesterol. It is important to properly cook shellfish to avoid foodborne illness. Seaweed is a type of seafood that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine, and is increasingly being used in other types of cuisine as well. It is a good source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and is often used in soups, salads, and sushi rolls.
